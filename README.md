# ORF-finder

This was a mini-project undertaken as part of MSc coursework along with a classmate [@swat08mx](https://github.com/swat08mx/ORF_finder). The goal was to familiarize ourselves with both languages (Python and R) and learn how the theoretical bioinformatics we studied gets translated into tools.
